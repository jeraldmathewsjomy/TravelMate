            <p class="para">Russia, the largest country in the world by land area, spans across Eastern Europe and northern Asia. It boasts a rich and diverse history, with its roots stretching back to the medieval state of Kievan Rus, which evolved into the Russian Empire in the 17th century. The Russian Empire was a major player on the world stage until the Russian Revolution of 1917, which led to the establishment of the Soviet Union. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the beginning of modern Russia, a federation with a complex political landscape and significant influence in global affairs. </p>
               <p class="para">Russia is renowned for its vast and varied landscapes, ranging from the icy expanses of Siberia to the temperate regions around Moscow and St. Petersburg. The country is also known for its rich cultural heritage, including contributions to literature, music, ballet, and art. Famous Russian figures such as Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Mikhail Bulgakov have left a lasting impact on global culture. Russian architecture is equally notable, with its distinctive onion-domed churches and historic palaces attracting visitors from around the world. </p>
                
                <p class="para">The Russian climate varies widely, from the harsh winters of Siberia to the milder conditions of the western regions. Despite its size and diverse climate, Russia is a country with a unified cultural identity, celebrated through festivals, traditions, and an enduring sense of pride in its history. Visitors to Russia can experience a blend of ancient and modern attractions, from the grandeur of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg to the vibrant nightlife of Moscow. </p>
